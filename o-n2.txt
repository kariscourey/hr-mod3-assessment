O(n2) worst-case complexity means that, in the worst case, as the number of elements to be computed increases linearly (e.g. 1, 2, 3 elements), the computational steps (representative of time) quadratically increases (e.g. 1, 4, 9 steps). This is usually the case with a nested for loop with only an outer and an inner loop. O(n2) is among the worst potential worst-case time complexities, with O(n1) and O(2^n) being the only worse cases. Bubble sort, selection sort, and quick sort, for example, are each exemplified by a worst-case complexity of O(n2).
